            <p> <b>CLOUD NATIVE COMPUTING</b> Refers to an approach to designing, building, and running applications that fully leverage the advantages of cloud computing. It emphasizes scalability, flexibility, and resilience by utilizing technologies such as containers, microservices, orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, and dynamic resource management. Cloud-native systems are designed to be modular, enabling components to be developed, deployed, and updated independently. This architecture allows for faster delivery of features, improved fault tolerance, and the ability to scale applications efficiently in response to demand. By embracing automation, observability, and infrastructure-as-code, cloud-native computing supports organizations in achieving agility and maintaining high performance in rapidly changing environments.
